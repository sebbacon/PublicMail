Hi Annie,

Actually Kim and I have visited before and we've had the tour and a
bit of a chat with people -- so we do know the place a little bit.
And I've therefore also seen the documents you sent already -- thanks.

We would plan to visit again soon in the new year, of course, but it
would be good to know the rough specs for the one-bedroom place, just
to know if it's even vaguely practical for us, before we take another
step.  In particular, the size/space and the cost?

Thanks,

Seb
