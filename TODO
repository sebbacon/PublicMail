Ensure the "please note" footer is always in every mail sent via the
   system

Make the browse interface more prominent; be structured about each
   email address having its own page, maybe with explicit name /
   description and tags for the addresses

   Include a way to see all recent conversations *when logged in*

Emphasise that the archive is permanent

Make it clear it's for communicating with organisations or famous
   people so you can share the communications.  Populate it with nice
   examples.

API that lets you post a new message, get back a URL.

In reading interface, collapse quotes

Consider having some way to curate lists of organisations / people
   (using tags?)

Store entire email source including headers

Approach George Monbiot, MediaLens, Guardian.  High-profile public
   debates taking place via the website.
